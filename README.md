With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), recent years have witnessed many promising studies on leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate human social behavior. While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called GenSim, which: (1) Abstracts a set of general functions to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) Supports one hundred thousand agents to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) Incorporates error-correction mechanisms to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.

## 2. Usage
### 2.1 Installation
#### 2.1.1 Install Agentscope

Install from source code (https://github.com/pan-x-c/AgentScope/tree/feature/pxc/async_create_agent). 
- Add two lines of code in the ``__init__`` function of `OpenAIWrapperBase` in the file `src/agentscope/models/openai_model.py`:

  ```python
  self.api_key = api_key
  self.client_args = client_args or {}
  ```

#### 2.1.2 Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/TangJiakai/GenSim.git
```

#### 2.1.3 Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2.2 Launching the Embedding Models
#### 2.2.1 [Optional] Running the Embedding Models
```
bash embedding_service/launch_multi_emb_models.sh
```
to launch the embedding model services.

You can also use other embedding APIs.

#### 2.2.2 Embedding-Model Configuration
Get the `embedding_api` (for example, [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8003/)), and fill that URL into `simulation/examples/<scenario>/configs/simulation_config.yml`.

### 2.3 Launching the LLM Models
#### 2.3.1 [Optional] Running the LLM Models
```bash
bash llm_service/launch_all_llm.sh
```
to launch the LLM model server.

You can also use other LLM APIs.

#### 2.3.2 LLM Configuration
Get the `llm_api` (for example, [http://localhost:8083/](http://localhost:8083/v1)), and fill that URL into `simulation/examples/<scenario>/configs/model_configs.json`. You can set multiply LLM models.

#### 2.3.3 Simualtion Configuration
Configure the following files in the configs directory of the specific scenario (e.g., `simulation/examples/<scenario>/configs`):

    - simulation_config.yml
    - memory_config.json
    - model_configs.json
    - xAgent_configs.json
    - yAgent_configs.json
    - ...

p.s. 
The `x` and `y` in the file names are placeholders for the specific agent class.


### 2.4 Starting Simulation
#### 2.4.1 Launch Distributed Agent Server
Run the following command to launch the distributed server:
```bash
bash simulation/launch_server.sh <server_num_per_host> <base_port> <scenario>
```

#### 2.4.2 Run Simulator
Run the following command to launch the simulator:
```python
python simulation/examples/<scenario>/simulator.py
```

#### 2.4.3 Kill Distributed Server
After the simulation is completed, you can kill the distributed server.

Run the following command to kill the distributed server:
```bash
bash simulation/kill_all_server.sh
```

## 3. Efficiency and Effectiveness of GenSim
### 3.1 Efficiency
#### 3.1.1 Time Cost :vs: Agent Quality

  <br>
  <b>Figure 3</b>: The time costs of different numbers of agents
</p>
From Figure 3, it can be seen that as the scale of the agents increases, the simulation time approximately shows a linear growth trend. 

#### 3.1.2 Time Cost :vs: GPU Number

  <b>Figure 4</b>: The time costs of different numbers of LLM
</p>
From Figure 4, it can be seen that as the number of GPUs increases, the simulation time decreases significantly.

</p>

We explore the evolution and enhancement of the model using two methods: SFT and PPO. 

- Figure 5(a) shows the impact of the number of training samples on the performance of the LLM-based agent. It is evident that the model demonstrates effective performance improvements across various sizes of training data. 

- Figure 5(b) illustrates the performance of continuous evolution enhancement in a multi-round setting, and it can be observed that our method has a good self-correction effect.
